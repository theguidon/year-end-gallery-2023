      "This photo was taken during the Fifth Noel concert held at the Areté Hyundai Hall last December 2022. I chose this particular photo because of my affinity with stage photography—how different modes of performance can work together to convey a message and evoke emotion. Theater and dance have risen to become active participants in my four years in the Ateneo. The way lyrics are pulled together and bodily movements create artistic pieces will always be an astounding experience. Photography, I believe, becomes a medium in which these experiences and emotions are forever frozen in time, allowing viewers to feel what the performers aim to convey over and over again.",
